# Parallel-Computing-2D_Heat_Parallelized
In this project, a finite difference scheme was used to determine temperature distribution after a determined number of time steps. 
The project was implemented in a serial version implementing a single core on a CPU and then implemented on a version utilizing MPI.
A strong and weak scaling study was done to show the speed up. The results from the predictive scheme were also compared to the analytical solution for accuracy. 
A pdf of the report and methods is included for those that are interested.
